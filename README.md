# Amara-RPG
A top-down, tiled, RPG game framework built on top of my existing game framework Amara (https://github.com/BigBossErndog/Amara-Framework)
Being used to develop the game The Black Flower Devours.

## What is this?
This provides classes for easy RPG making, inspired by RPG Maker by Degica / Kadokawa Corporation. Like classes for tile based movement, cutscenes, event triggers and more.
Still in development as I make my own game: The Black Flower Devours.
